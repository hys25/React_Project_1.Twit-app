This is my first application on **React**. Here I've learned how to work with components in React, JSX preprocessor, learned about properties and states of components. 

The application has such interactive features:
- add new posts
- liking post click on post text)
- delete post
- to mark the post as important
- sort post all / liked 
- there is a post search by typed characters
- all the posts are counted, and the posts you like are also counted.
